# Cyber's Free UdonSharp Scripts for VRChat

Hello, VRChat creators! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cyber, and I've put together a collection of UdonSharp scripts for anyone looking to add fun and interactive elements to their VRChat worlds. Feel free to use and modify them for your projects!

## Quick Start

## To use these scripts, you'll need:

    Unity 2022.3.6f1
    UdonSharp

## Here's how to get started:

    Create Component on GameObject.
    Add UdonBehaviour Component.
    Create UdonSharp Script.
    Assign Script to UdonBehaviour.

## Available Scripts

- **BouncyObject.cs** - Makes objects bounce when interacted with.
- **Teleporter.cs** - Teleports players around your world.


## More scripts are on their way, so stay tuned!

Please give credit to me, CyberWaveX in your game if you do use any of these scripts. Thanks :)
